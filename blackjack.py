			King, Queens, and Jacks are worth 10 points.
			Aces are worth 1 or 11 points.
			Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
			(H)it takes another card.
			(S)tand stops taking card and plays your hand.
			On your first play, you can (D)ouble down to increase your bet
			but you will be forced to hit before standing.
			In case of a tie, the bet is returned to the player.
			The dealer stops hitting at 17.''')
